# Speech-to-Text
Real-Time Speech-to-Text Grammar Corrector
Technologies Used: Python · SpeechRecognition · Hugging Face Transformers · NLP · T5 Model
This project combines real-time speech recognition with advanced grammar correction using a transformer-based NLP model. Users can speak naturally into a microphone, and the system transcribes their speech, cleans up punctuation, and corrects grammar using the vennify/t5-base-grammar-correction model.
🔧 Features:
- Speech-to-Text Conversion: Captures spoken input using Google’s speech recognition API.
- Grammar & Punctuation Correction: Applies NLP post-processing and transformer-based grammar correction.
- Error Handling: Gracefully manages audio recognition failures and network issues.
- Modular Design: Cleanly structured for easy extension or integration into larger applications.
💡 Use Cases:
- Language learning and pronunciation practice
- Real-time transcription for meetings or interviews
- Assistive tech for non-native English speakers
This project reflects my interest in natural language processing and practical AI applications. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or fork it for your own use!
